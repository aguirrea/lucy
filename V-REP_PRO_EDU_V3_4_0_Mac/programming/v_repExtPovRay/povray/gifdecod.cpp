 * Copyright (C) 1987, by Steven A. Bennett
 *
 * Permission is given by the author to freely redistribute and include
 * this code in any program as long as this credit is given where due.
 *
 * In accordance with the above, I want to credit Steve Wilhite who wrote
 * the code which this is heavily inspired by...
 *
 * GIF and 'Graphics Interchange Format' are trademarks (tm) of
 * Compuserve, Incorporated, an H&R Block Company.
 *
 * Release Notes: This file contains a decoder routine for GIF images
 * which is similar, structurally, to the original routine by Steve Wilhite.
 * It is, however, somewhat noticably faster in most cases.
 *
 == This routine was modified for use in FRACTINT in two ways.
 == 
 == 1) The original #includes were folded into the routine strictly to hold
 ==    down the number of files we were dealing with.
 ==
 == 2) The 'stack', 'suffix', 'prefix', and 'buf' arrays were changed from
 ==    static and 'malloc()'ed to external only so that the assembler
 ==    program could use the same array space for several independent
 ==    chunks of code.  Also, 'stack' was renamed to 'dstack' for TASM
 ==    compatibility.
 == 
 == 3) The 'out_line()' external function has been changed to reference 
 ==    '*outln()' for flexibility (in particular, 3D transformations)
 ==
 == 4) A call to 'keypressed()' has been added after the 'outln()' calls
 ==    to check for the presenc of a key-press as a bail-out signal
 ==
 == (Bert Tyler and Timothy Wegner)

/* 
   This routine was modified for Persistence of Vision(tm) Ray Tracer in the following ways:

   1)  Removed calls to buzzer() and keypressed() to get rid of ASM files.

   2)  The dstack, suffix, and prefix arrays were made STATIC once again.

   3)  Added the usual ANSI function prototypes, etc. in the Persistence of Vision(tm) Ray Tracer headers.
