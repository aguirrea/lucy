<h1>Script editor</h1>


<p>The script editor allows editing the various scripts in V-REP. It is opened by double-clicking a script in the <a href="scriptProperties.htm">script dialog</a>, or by double-clicking a script icon in the <a href="userInterface.htm#SceneHierarchy">scene hierarchy</a>.<br>
</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Script editor]</p>
<br>

<p>The script editor has following features that make the code edition easier:</p>
<li>auto-completion</li>
<li>call tips</li>
<li>syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Highlighting of all occurrences of selected word</li>
<li>source folding/unfolding</li>
<li>simple word search via the &lt;ctrl+f&gt; key</li>
<li>no need for explicit saving</li>

<p>The API functions can easily be accessed by typing the first 3 letters (usually &quot;sim&quot;). Copy/paste and undo/redo functionality of the script editor is supported through a popup menu (right-click). When a script was modified, there is no need to explicitly save the changes: closing the script editor, saving the scene or starting a <a href="simulation.htm">simulation</a> will automatically apply the changes to the script. When a simulation is running, modifications to a given script will only have an effect once a new simulation run is started, except for <a href="customizationScripts.htm">customization scripts</a> that will always apply changes once the editor was closed. </p>

<p>If you have recurring functions you wish to access from a given script, you can add following line at the top of your script:</p>

<pre class=lightRedBox>
require "myExternalLuaFile"
</pre>

<p>In that case, make sure the file is named <em>myExternalLuaFile.lua</em>, and do not forget to distribute it together with your scene or model, since that code will not be part of a V-REP file anymore.</p>


<p>If you wish to use a particular editor to edit V-REP's embedded scripts, then refer to the entry <strong>externalScriptEditor</strong> in the user settings file <em>system/usrset.txt</em>. For proper keyword highlighting, auto-completion and call tip display, use the data in file <em>v-rep_notepad++.zip</em> (in the installation directory).</p>
