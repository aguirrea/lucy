<p>This is the first developed custom UI type, and is based on OpenGl. It is relatively flexible, but might be unpractical and overly time-consuming when developing complex UIs. Additionally, it is unlikely that it will be further developed or improved in future. For that reason, we highly recommend to use the <a href="customUIPlugin.htm">Qt-based custom UIs</a> instead.</p>
<p>The OpenGl-based custom UI can take the form of dialogs that integrate buttons, edit-boxes, sliders or labels. Any action on custom UIs (e.g. button-click, text edition, slider movement) is reported as a message that can be intercepted by appropriate <a href="apisOverview.htm">API</a> calls. This allows customizing a simulation to a great extent. Following displays several OpenGl-based custom UI examples:<br>

<p>
OpenGl-based custom UIs can be free (unassociated), or associated with <a href="objects.htm">objects</a>. In the case a custom UI is associated with a scene object, copying/pasting/cutting/deleting the object will also automatically copy/paste/cut/delete the associated custom UI. This is an important feature (e.g. when copying a robot that displays its proximity sensor readings in a custom UI, you also want the sensor display to be copied). OpenGl-based custom UIs are saved together with a <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a> (all OpenGl-based custom UIs are saved), or together with a <a href="models.htm">model</a> if associated with any object in the model. OpenGl-based custom UIs can also be saved/loaded on their own: [Menu bar --&gt; File --&gt; Save OpenGl-based custom UIs as...] or [Menu bar --&gt; File --&gt; Load OpenGl-based custom UIs...]</p>

<p>
If you prefer using customized Windows style dialogs instead of OpenGl-based custom UIs, refer to the <a href="plugins.htm">plugin section</a>. Additionally, make sure to have a look at the <a href="customUIPlugin.htm">Qt-based custom UIs</a>, which is the prefered method. </p>
