Packets
=======

Contains utilities for creating packets for reading and writing to and from
Dynamixels.

Data is exchaned between the computer and the servo using packets.

All packets have the following format:

    [0xFF] [0xFF] [data1] [data2] ... [dataN] [checksum]

where ``checksum`` is the complement of the lowest byte of the sum of the data bytes.
