Chain
=====

This module is designed to make it easy to control multiple servos in a synchronized manner
using less code.

This module further implements functionality which is important in applications such as
kinematic chains, which contain a number of interconnected servos. In a robotic arm,
for example, it is important to ensure that all of the joints have completed moving to
the first target position before the arm starts moving to a second position.

This library need not only be used for kinetic chains; it can be used in any
application where it is required to control multiple servos in a synchronized manner.


The position of the servos is controlled using vectors. Each vector contains a list of
tuples, each containing a servo id, the target position, and the velocity at which the
servo should move. For example:

    servo_id = 1
    target_position = 512
    velocity = 180

    vector_tuple = (servo_id, target_position, velocity)

Given multiple vectors, the ``move_to_vector()`` method can be used to move every servo
for every tuple at once. For example:

    from pydynamixel import chain, dynamixel

    # You'll need to change this to the serial port of your USB2Dynamixel
    serial_port = '/dev/tty.usbserial-A921X77J'
    ser = dynamixel.get_serial_for_url(serial_port)

    vector = [
        (1, 822, 180),
        (2, 94, 140),
        (3, 929, 100)
    ]

    chain.move_to_vector(ser, vector)

Moving multiple servos through multiple frames using this vector syntax is
quite combersome. If the servo ids and velocities are constant, the ``make_vector()``
convenience method can be used:

    from pydynamixel import chain, dynamixel

    # You'll need to change this to the serial port of your USB2Dynamixel
    serial_port = '/dev/tty.usbserial-A921X77J'
    ser = dynamixel.get_serial_for_url(serial_port)

    servo_ids = [1,2,3]
    velocities = [180,140,100]

    vector_1 = make_vector(servo_ids, [822, 94, 929], velocities)
    vector_2 = make_vector(servo_ids, [822, 632, 391], velocities)

The following example demonstrates the process of manipulating the robot using a series of frames.

    from pydynamixel import chain, dynamixel

    joints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    velocity = 180

    # Initialize the servos
    chain.init(ser, joints, velocity)

    # A list of frames each consisting of the target
    # displacements for each joint
    pos = [[822, 94, 929, 919, 104, 820, 691],
        [822, 632, 391, 919, 104, 523, 561],
        [822, 640, 383, 911, 112, 516, 650],
        [822, 100, 923, 918, 105, 538, 650],
        [818, 100, 923, 918, 105, 538, 650],
        [495, 100, 923, 918, 105, 538, 650],
        [495, 714, 309, 802, 221, 538, 650],
        [495, 723, 300, 791, 232, 538, 569],
        [495, 103, 920, 916, 107, 538, 571],
        [495, 103, 920, 916, 107, 538, 571],
        [495, 723, 300, 791, 232, 538, 569],
        [495, 714, 309, 802, 221, 538, 650],
        [495, 100, 923, 918, 105, 538, 650],
        [818, 100, 923, 918, 105, 538, 650],
        [822, 100, 923, 918, 105, 538, 650],
        [822, 640, 383, 911, 112, 516, 650],
        [822, 632, 391, 919, 104, 523, 561],
        [822, 94, 929, 919, 104, 820, 691]]

    # Iterate over the vectors, move to each,
    # and wait for each move to complete
    for v in pos:
        vector = chain.make_vector_constant_velocity(v, joints, velocity)
        chain.move_to_vector(ser, vector)
        chain.wait_for_move(ser, joints)

Fore each vector, after instructing the joints to move to the specified position,
the program waits until all servos have finished moving before moving to the next frame.
